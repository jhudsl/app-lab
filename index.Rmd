## Course Description

Are you interested in building data apps to help save the world, start the next 
big business, or just to see if you can? We run a data app prototyping class 
for people interested in creating these apps. We partner with people at the 
university and around the community to generate app ideas that matter.

One of the principles of our approach is that _anyone_ can prototype an app. 
Our class starts with some tutorials on [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). While we have no formal pre-reqs for the class
you will have much more fun if you have the background equivalent to our 
Coursera classes: 

- [Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools)
- [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
- [Building R packages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-packages)
- [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products)

We will mostly be able to support development with R and Shiny but would be 
pumped to accept people with other kinds of development background - we just 
might not be able to give a lot of technical assistance. 

To see some examples of apps we will be building check out our [gallery](http://jhudatascience.org/data_app_gallery.html).
